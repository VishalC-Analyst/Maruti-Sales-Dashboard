# Maruti-Sales-Dashboard
# Maruti Suzuki Executive Sales Dashboard (Mock Project)

Interactive web dashboard prototype for a Maruti Suzuki sales analytics scenario, built with AI assistance (HTML, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js). It uses synthetic data generated in code. This is a mock project and is not affiliated with Maruti Suzuki.

## Requirements (my brief)
- KPIs: Gross revenue, net profit (12% margin), units sold, total bookings, cancellation rate
- Filters: Year (2022 to 2025), Region, Regional Manager, Vehicle Segment (Hatchback / SUV)
- Visuals: Monthly sales trend, product mix (Swift vs Brezza), regional manager leaderboard

## Data
- Synthetic monthly records for 2022 to 2025 (384 records: 48 months x 4 regions x 2 products), generated in JavaScript
- Regional hierarchy mapping each region to its manager:
  - North: P. Banerjee
  - South: S. Srivastava
  - East: B. Dheer
  - West: R.S. Akella
- Product catalogue:
  - Hatchback: Swift (base price Rs 6,00,000)
  - SUV: Brezza (base price Rs 9,00,000)

## Metric Logic
- **Gross Revenue:** price x quantity
- **Net Profit:** sales x 12% (a fixed margin assumption)
- **Units Sold and Order Volume:** total quantity and order count
- **Cancellation Rate:** returned orders / total orders x 100 (returns are randomly flagged in the generated data)

## Features
- Real-time filters for year, region, manager and segment
- 5 KPI cards and 3 charts: monthly sales trend (line), vehicle share (doughnut), manager leaderboard (horizontal bar)
- Maruti-style colour theme: deep blue (#003399) and accent red (#E2000F)

## Limitations
- All numbers are synthetic and for demonstration only
- The dashboard does not read the sample CSV files
- No real relationships or DAX: calculations are written in JavaScript

## Tools
HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js

## Files
- [maruti_dashboard.html](maruti_dashboard.html) : open in a browser to view the dashboard
